# Dolce-Plaza-SQL-Database
A repository for my final project for the Code First Girls Introduction to Data &amp; SQL course. 

As part of the final project for the course, the task was to create a database with a minimum of 5 tables, and include core requirements and some advanced options based on the skills taught during the course. 

The main core requirements were:
1. Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
2. Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
3. Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
4. In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
5. Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
6. Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

My chosen final project was based on a hotel database: Dolce Plaza SQL database. 

A hotel has a large number of data that is associated with it's operations. Each hotel could have multiple floors and rooms. Each room can be a different type, and therefore can have a different cost. The hotel booking system must be able to store data on the bookings made, including guest information and contact details. The same database must also allow data to be held about their employees, including contact information and addresses. 


I have included 8 tables in my database:
Hotel
Rooms
Rooms Booked
Employees
Room Type
Stay Bookings
Address Information
Guest
